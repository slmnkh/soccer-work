% Optimal soft hyergraph matching.
%
% Algorithm due to R. Zass and A. Shashua.,
% 'Probabilistic Graph and Hypergraph Matching.',
% Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Anchorage, Alaska, June 2008.
%
% Y - Marginalization of the hyperedge-to-hyperedge correspondences matrix.
% numberOfMatches - number of matches required.
%
% X [Output] - an n1 by n2 matrix with the hard matching results.
%             The i,j entry is one iff the i-th feature of the first object
%             match the j-th feature of the second object. Zero otherwise.
% Z [Output] - an n1 by n2 matrix with the soft matching results.
%             The i,j entry is the probablity that the i-th feature of the
%             first object match the j-th feature of the second object.

% - graphMatching() as an example on how to use this for graphs with a
%  specific similarity function.
