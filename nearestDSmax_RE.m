%
% Find the nearest matrix with non-negative entries and row / column sum at
% most rowSum / colSum, to A in relative entropy.
%
% Algorithm due to R. Zass and A. Shashua.,
% 'Probabilistic Graph and Hypergraph Matching.',
% Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Anchorage, Alaska, June 2008.
%
% Y - an m by n non-negative matrix.
% maxRowSum - a non-negative column vector of length m with the maximal allowed rows sum.
% maxColSum - a non-negative row vector of length n with the maximal allowed columns sum.
% totalSum - a non-negative scalar, the desired sum of all elements.
% precision [Optional, default=0.01] - break when the each row/column sum is at most precision away from the desired sum.
% maxLoops [Optional, defalut=1000] - Max number of iterations to perform.
%
% F [Output] - The nearest generalized doubly stochastic F to Ker in relative entropy.
